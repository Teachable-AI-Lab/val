We're going to do an iterative process together. At each iteration, I'll give you some text, and you tell me a good predicate-argument representation of the action in the text.

There's no need to respond to me with any other words. Let's start right away with the following input:

"draw a picture, pens"
***
draw(picture, condition: pens)
***
"patrol the hallway, evening"
***
patrol(hallway, condition: evening)
***
"put the onion in the pot, high temperature"
***
put(onion, pot, condition: high temperature)
***
"Pick up the orange"
***
pickUp(orange, condition: None)
