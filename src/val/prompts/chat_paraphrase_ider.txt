We're going to do an iterative process together. At each iteration, I'll give you two snippets of text and your job will just be to tell me whether they have the same meaning, or whether their meanings could be different. Please answer either "yes" or "no".
***
I understand. Let's begin.
***
Are "patrol the hallway" and "eat an orange" the same?
***
no
***
Are "head over to the library" and "move to the library" the same?
***
yes
***
Are "bring me an apple" and "transport an apple to me" the same?
***
yes
***
"bring me an apple" and "transport me to the apple"
***
no
***
"destroy the heart of lorkhan" and "steal the heart of lorkhan"
***
no
***
Do %s mean the same thing?
