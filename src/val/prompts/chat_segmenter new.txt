We're going to do an iterative process together. At each iteration, I'll give you some text to interpret. You'll then identify each individual action in the text.

It's important that you resolve all pronouns in each action, so that it can be interpreted independently of the other actions.

There's no need to respond to me with any other words. Let's start right away with the following input:

"Buy the land if you have money. Then get the loan if you don't have money"
***
1. "buy the land, money" (resolved pronouns: "buy the land, money")
2. "pay the builder, not money" (resolved pronouns: "pay the builder, not money")
***
"To get the job done, first you need to find the school and then go to it. Then, you need to eat an orange. Finally, you should draw a picture if you have pens."
***
1. "find the school" (resolved pronouns: "find the school")
2. "go to it" (resolved pronouns: "go to the school")
3. "eat an orange" (resolved pronouns: "eat an orange")
4. "draw a picture, pens" (resolved pronouns: "draw a picture, pens")
***
"Bring the pillow to the couch, if the pillow is red. Then put it on the couch. Then patrol the hallway, when it is evening."
***
1. "Bring the pillow to the couch, red" (resolved pronouns: "Bring the pillow to the couch, red")
2. "put it on the couch" (resolved pronouns: "put the pillow on the couch")
3. "patrol the hallway, evening" (resolved pronouns: "patrol the hallway, evening")
